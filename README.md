# Pacman Simulator Version 1.0

I used a hacky way of building this app, as I had little time to get it done. I'll consider this my 'Pacman Simulator Version 1.0'. I plan on further developing it and making a real game out of it. I learnt a lot out of this and really enjoyed my time.

This runs in the terminal/command line. Once you have cloned the repo, you can run it in terminal by entering the following command:
        
    ~/pacman/ $ ruby code_challenge_1.rb

Then follow the prompts.

Have fun!
